## Overview

This is my first challenge given by Frontend Mentor. I have used vanilla HTML and CSS to complete this challenge and Flexbox to align content at the center.

## My process

First, I wrote all the HTML code and then I started with CSS. I used Flexbox to align the content at the center and after that I added remaning styles.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Before this challenge, I had never created a README.md file. I feel exhausted whenever I thought of making one but, for this challenge I had to make one. Initially, it was hard but with the provided template it become easy for me.


### Continued development

I would surely create more README.md files for my future projects. I would also like to learn more about choosing a nice layout.
